    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Savour the flavour of parmesan cheese with hot, buttered noodles, whipped eggs, crispy bacon with cream.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <u1>
        <li>½ pound bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </u1>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat together eggs and cream in a medium bowl until just blended. Stir in Parmesan cheese and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add softened butter to the pot and toss with pasta until butter is melted. Add bacon and egg-cheese mixture. Stir until the heat of pasta cooks eggs, then garnish with parsley and black pepper to serve.</li>
    </ol>
